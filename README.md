Autonomous Mistral agents born into real cities, living real lives. Running locally on a single GPU.

Stanford simulated a town. **Inception simulates reality.**

## What It Does

Inception drops AI agents into the real world — not a fictional sandbox. They navigate actual streets, enter real cafés, form relationships, keep secrets, and make decisions no one programmed them to make.

Each agent runs a full cognitive architecture:

- **Memory Stream** — every observation stored, timestamped, scored by recency/importance/relevance
- **Reflection** — higher-order beliefs synthesized from accumulated memories
- **Planning** — daily plans recursively decomposed into sub-actions anchored to real coordinates and real time
- **Grounded Reality** — agents walk to Le Consulat, 18 Rue Norvins, Paris — not "The Café"
- **Voice** — persistent ElevenLabs voice clones; every word spoken, every inflection emergent
- **Social Cognition** — trust graphs, gossip propagation, emotional valence

## Quick Start

```bash
inception --city paris --agents 4 --model mistral-7b-ft --local
```

```
agents: 4 alive · memories: 3,241 · reflections: 187
world: paris · radius: 1.2km · places: 23 loaded
status: all systems nominal
```
